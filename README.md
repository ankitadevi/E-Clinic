Implemented a health assessment system using machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural
Networks) to predict health scores and provide personalized recommendations. Utilized Python, data preprocessing
libraries, and visualization tools, integrating Generative AI platforms like OpenAI and LangChain for adaptive
conversational interfaces and user-centric health insights
